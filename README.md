# YouthMobilityHub
Graduation project

### This application was developed using the MERN stack and serves as a platform for NGOs to share their Youth Exchange or other Erasmus+ related opportunities.
 This repo contains the source code for both the backend and frontend, for showcasing, as the application is not deployed and still under development.
